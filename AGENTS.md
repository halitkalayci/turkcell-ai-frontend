## 1) HOW TO WORK (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)

### 1.1 Plan-First, then code

Before generating code, you MUST:

- Propose a FILE BREAKDOWN (what files will be created/changed + why)

- Ask QUESTIONS for missing details instead of guessing.

### 1.2 No INVENTING

You MUST NOT invent:

- endpoints, request/response fields, error models

- event names/payloads

- API endpoints for frontend

- Business rules

- Anything architectural

If any detail is missing, ASK.

### 1.3 Documentation

- You MUST NOT create any .md files unless it is requested.

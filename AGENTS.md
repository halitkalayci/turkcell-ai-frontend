## 1) HOW TO WORK (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)

### 1.1 Plan-First, then code

Before generating code, you MUST:

- Propose a FILE BREAKDOWN (what files will be created/changed + why)

- Ask QUESTIONS for missing details instead of guessing.

### 1.2 No INVENTING

You MUST NOT invent:

- endpoints, request/response fields, error models

- event names/payloads

- API endpoints for frontend

- Business rules

- Anything architectural

If any detail is missing, ASK.

### 1.3 Documentation

- You MUST NOT create any .md files unless it is requested.

## 2) CONTRACT FIRST

### 2.1 OpenAPI is the source of truth

- API contracts live under: `/docs/openapi`

- Implementation MUST follow the contract; never the other way around.

### 2.2 Code Generation Policy

- We may use OpenAPI tooling ONLY if already present in the repository.

- You MUST NOT add new OpenAPI generator dependencies without explicit approval.

- If no generator is available, implement controllers/DTOs manually to match the spec.

### 2.3 Versioning

- API Changes MUST be versioned. (eg. `api/v1/orders`, `/api/v2/orders`)

- Version MUST be placed in path.

- Breaking changes require a new version; do not silently break clients.
